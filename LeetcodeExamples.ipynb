Since each process task on the machine has a pair of start and end timestamps, the time consumption of each process task can be calculated by subtracting the start timestamp from the end timestamp. Therefore, we can use the CASE WHEN or IF function to calculate the time consumption of each process task, and then use the AVG function to calculate the average time consumption of all process tasks on each machine.\n",
